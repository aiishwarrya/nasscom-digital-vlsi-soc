- A **bad floorplan** can lead to congestion, delays, and inefficiencies.

Floorplanning involves defining regions for:
- Core logic
- Input/Output (I/O) pads
- Other design elements within the chip layout

**Library cells** are pre-designed, pre-verified logic components provided in standard cell libraries.  
These cells include:
- Basic logic gates
- Flip-flops
- Multiplexers  

These cells are optimized for specific process technologies such as SKY130 and serve as the building blocks for integrated circuits.

---

## SKY130_D2_SK1 - Chip Floor Planning Considerations

Chip floor planning considerations focus on organizing the placement of various blocks and cells to ensure optimal functionality, performance, and manufacturability.  

Key factors to consider:

5. **I/O Placement:** Strategically placing input/output pads to reduce signal delays and ease external connectivity.

An ideal floorplan ensures proper balance among these considerations, resulting in a robust and efficient chip design.

---

## SKY_L1 - Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio


#### **1. Utilization Factor (UF):**  
The utilization factor is defined as the ratio of the total area occupied by logic cells to the total core area of the chip.

**Formula:**  
**UF = (Total Logic Cell Area) / (Total Core Area)**

- A **high utilization factor** (e.g., 80%) indicates efficient use of silicon but may cause routing congestion.
- A **low utilization factor** provides more space for routing but may increase chip size.

#### **2. Aspect Ratio (AR):**  
The aspect ratio defines the proportions of the core area and is expressed as the ratio of the core height to its width.

**Formula:**  
**AR = (Core Height) / (Core Width)**

- **AR = 1:** Indicates a square layout, ideal for uniform routing.
- **AR â‰  1:** May result in challenges in power distribution and signal integrity.

Designers aim for:
- A utilization factor between **50% to 80%**.
- An aspect ratio close to **1** to achieve an optimal floorplan and reduce design complexity.

---
## SKY_L2 - Concept of Pre-Placed Cells

Pre-placed cells are essential blocks positioned in fixed locations during the floorplanning stage to optimize chip functionality and layout.

By providing a stable voltage supply, decoupling capacitors ensure consistent performance across the chip.

### Noise Margin Summary:
Noise margin is a measure of a circuit's ability to tolerate noise without compromising its logical operation.  
- **Key Parameters:**
  - **NMH (Noise Margin High):** The difference between the minimum output high voltage and the minimum input high voltage required by the next stage.  
  - **NML (Noise Margin Low):** The difference between the maximum output low voltage and the maximum input low voltage required by the next stage.  
- **Importance:** A higher noise margin ensures better immunity to noise, improving the robustness of the circuit.  

The incorporation of decoupling capacitors aids in maintaining proper noise margins by stabilizing the supply voltage.

     - Optimize buffer locations to balance signal integrity and power consumption.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Reduces skew and delay in clock distribution networks.
     - Improves overall signal quality in the design.

#### 3. **Routing of Different Components:**
   - **Critical Routing**: Prioritize the routing of high-speed and power-critical nets (e.g., clock and reset signals).
   - **Minimizing Crosstalk**: Maintain adequate spacing between parallel signal routes to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk.
   - **Layer Optimization**: Use metal layers effectively for signal routing, with higher layers for global signals and lower layers for local interconnections.
   - **Routing Congestion Analysis**: Identify and resolve bottlenecks in densely packed regions to prevent design rule violations.

#### Final Optimization Goals:
- Ensure proper alignment and abutment of all components to achieve efficient area utilization.
- Use buffers strategically to manage delays and improve signal integrity.
- Optimize routing paths to minimize wire-length, parasitics, and congestion.

By performing final placement optimization with careful attention to abutment, buffer insertion, and routing, designers can achieve a highly efficient and reliable VLSI design.

### **SKY_L4 - Introduction to Delay Tables**  

#### **Power-Aware Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):**  
Power-aware CTS is a specialized approach to designing clock trees in digital circuits. It focuses on minimizing power consumption while maintaining the performance of the clock tree. The goal is to reduce dynamic and leakage power without compromising clock integrity or timing accuracy. This involves balancing factors such as skew, latency, and power dissipation during the synthesis process.

#### **Delay Tables - Introduction:**  
A delay table is a structured data representation that provides delay values for various cell types under different operating conditions. It includes information about:  
1. **Input Slew:** The rate at which the input signal changes.  
2. **Output Load:** The load the cell drives, typically measured in capacitance.  
3. **Timing Characteristics:** Delay values for rising and falling edges, capturing the cellâ€™s behavior under specified conditions.  

These tables help design tools accurately calculate path delays and optimize timing, ensuring the design meets performance constraints.

---

### **SKY_L5 - Delay Table Usage Part 1 & SKY_L6 - Delay Table Usage Part 2**  

#### **Levels of Buffering**  
Buffering is a crucial aspect of circuit design, used to:  
1. Strengthen weak signals.  
2. Drive larger loads efficiently.  
3. Reduce delays by appropriately placing buffers between high-capacitance nodes.  

The placement and sizing of buffers significantly influence timing and power performance.  

#### **Delay Tables for Buffer Sizes**  
Delay tables provide timing information for various buffer sizes under different conditions:  
- **Size 1 Buffer:** A smaller buffer optimized for driving low loads with minimal power.  
- **Size 2 Buffer:** A larger buffer capable of driving higher loads at the cost of slightly increased power and area.  

Each buffer size has its own delay characteristics, captured in its respective delay table.  

#### **Input Slew and Output Load Impact**  
1. **Input Slew:** Refers to how quickly a signal transitions from low to high or vice versa. A slower slew can increase delay, while a faster slew reduces it.  
2. **Output Load:** Represents the load the buffer drives, typically measured in capacitance. Higher loads lead to increased delay, emphasizing the importance of matching buffer strength to load requirements.  

Understanding these parameters ensures efficient circuit design with optimal performance and power trade-offs.

## Implementation of SKY130_D4_SK1 - SKY_L1, SKY_L2, SKY_L3

### Standard Cell Layout Rules and Requirements

This document outlines the essential rules for designing standard cells in the SKY130 process. Adhering to these rules ensures compatibility with automated tools, seamless routing, and compliance with design-for-manufacturing (DFM) guidelines.


#### **Rules for Standard Cell Layout**

#### 1. Input and Output Port Alignment
- **Requirement:** Input and output ports must be located at the intersection of horizontal and vertical routing tracks.
- **Purpose:** 
  - Enables seamless signal routing.
  - Ensures compatibility with the grid defined for automated place-and-route (PnR) processes.

#### 2. Standard Cell Width
- **Requirement:** The width of the standard cell must be an **odd multiple of the x-pitch** (0.46 Âµm for SKY130).
- **Examples:** Valid widths include:
  - \( 0.46 \, \mu\text{m}, 1.38 \, \mu\text{m}, 2.3 \, \mu\text{m}, \dots \)
- **Purpose:**
  - Maintains alignment with horizontal track spacing.
  - Simplifies horizontal routing and ensures manufacturability.

#### 3. Standard Cell Height
- **Requirement:** The height of the standard cell must be an **even multiple of the y-pitch**.
- **Examples:** Valid heights include:
  - \( 0.92 \, \mu\text{m}, 1.84 \, \mu\text{m}, 2.76 \, \mu\text{m}, \dots \)
- **Purpose:**
  - Ensures compatibility with vertical track spacing.
  - Facilitates power, ground, and signal routing across multiple rows of standard cells.


#### **Purpose of These Rules:**
1. **Manufacturability:** Ensures compliance with DFM guidelines, minimizing risks during fabrication.
2. **Design Automation:** Simplifies integration with automated tools like synthesis, PnR, and timing analysis.
3. **Uniformity:** Maintains consistent cell placement and connectivity across the design.

#### **Why These Rules Matter?**
These guidelines form the backbone of standard cell library development, ensuring robust, scalable, and manufacturable designs for the SKY130 PDK.

## Implementation of SKY130_D4_SK2 - SKY_L3, SKY_L4, SKY_L5

---

### 1. Post-Synthesis Timing Analysis with OpenSTA

Since we have a 0 WNS (Worst Negative Slack) after the improved timing run, we will perform timing analysis on the initial synthesis run, which contains several violations without any added parameters for timing improvement.

#### Steps to Invoke the OpenLANE Flow, Include New LEF, and Perform Synthesis

1. **Navigate to the OpenLANE Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
   ```

2. **Invoke OpenLANE Docker Sub-System**:
   Since we have aliased the long Docker command to `docker`, we can invoke the OpenLANE flow Docker sub-system by running:
   ```bash
   docker
   ```

3. **Enter Interactive Mode in OpenLANE**:
   ```tcl
   ./flow.tcl -interactive
   ```

4. **Load OpenLANE Package and Prepare the Design**:
   ```tcl
   package require openlane 0.9
   prep -design picorv32a
   ```

5. **Include Newly Added LEF Files**:
   ```tcl
   set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
   add_lefs -src $lefs
   ```

6. **Set SYNTH_SIZING Environment Variable**:
   ```tcl
   set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1
   ```

7. **Run Synthesis**:
   ```tcl
   run_synthesis
   ```

   **Final Screenshot of Commands Run**:
   ![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-27.png)

#### Running STA in Another Terminal

1. **Navigate to the OpenLANE Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
   ```

2. **Invoke OpenSTA with the Pre-STA Configuration**:
   ```bash
   sta pre_sta.conf
   ```

   **Screenshots of Commands Run**:
    ![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-31.png)
    ![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-30.png)

    The `pre_sta.conf` file for STA analysis is located in the `openlane` directory.
      ![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-29.png)
   
    The `my_base.sdc` file for STA analysis is created in the `openlane/designs/picorv32a/src` directory based on `openlane/scripts/base.sdc`.
      ![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-28.png)

#### Optimizing Timing by Reducing Fanout

Since higher fanout causes more delay, we can reduce the fanout and re-run synthesis.

1. **Prepare the Design Again with a New Tag**:
   ```tcl
   prep -design picorv32a -tag 17-01_17-45 -overwrite
   ```

2. **Include Newly Added LEF Files**:
   ```tcl
   set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
   add_lefs -src $lefs
   ```

3. **Set SYNTH_SIZING and SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT Environment Variables**:
   ```tcl
   set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1
   set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4
   ```

4. **Check the Current Value of SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL**:
   ```tcl
   echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)
   ```

5. **Run Synthesis Again**:
   ```tcl
   run_synthesis
   ```

   **Final Screenshot of Commands Run**:
   ![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-32.png)

### 10. Timing ECO Fixes to Remove Violations

To remove timing violations, we start by analyzing and optimizing timing by replacing OR gates of drive strength 2 with OR gates of drive strength 4. This process helps manage fanouts and improve slack.

Start by reporting all the connections to a net using the command:
```tcl
report_net -connections _10566_
```

Check the command syntax for replacing cells:
```tcl
help replace_cell
```

Replace the cell driving 4 fanouts with a stronger drive strength:
```tcl
replace_cell _13165_ sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4
```

Generate a custom timing report to evaluate the changes:
```tcl
report_checks -fields {net cap slew input_pins} -digits 4
```

![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-34.png)

Result - slack reduced.
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-35.png)

Repeat the above steps for other nets experiencing similar issues. For example, for the net `_11675_`, replace the corresponding cell and generate a report:
```tcl
report_net -connections _10563_

replace_cell _13161_ sky130_fd_sc_hd__or3_4

report_checks -fields {net cap slew input_pins} -digits 4
```
Command runs
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-36.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-37.png)

Result - slack reduced.
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-38.png)

Continue to address nets like `_13132_` and `_13157_` in a similar manner to further optimize timing. Each time, replace the cell with a stronger drive strength and verify the slack reduction.

this is for cell `_13132_`
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-39.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-40.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-41.png)

this is for cell `_13157_` as the delay time is 1.5317
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-42.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-43.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-44.png)


Finally, verify that the instance `_27762_` has been replaced with the stronger drive strength OR gate:
```tcl
report_checks -from _27860_ -to _27762_ -through _26365_
```
Screenshot of replaced instance.
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-45.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-46.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-47.png)

After making these changes, the worst negative slack (WNS) is reduced from -23.9000 ns to -22.6173 ns, an improvement of approximately 1.2827 ns.

### 11. Replacing the Old Netlist and Running PnR Stages

With the timing ECO fixes applied, we replace the old netlist with the newly generated netlist. This updated netlist will be used for the physical design flow, including floorplanning, placement, and clock tree synthesis (CTS).

First, make a copy of the old netlist:
```bash
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/17-01-17-45/results/synthesis/
ls
cp picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v
ls
```
Screenshot of commands run.
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-48.png)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-49.png)

Overwrite the current synthesis netlist with the updated one:
```tcl
help write_verilog
write_verilog /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v
exit
```

Verify that the netlist has been overwritten by checking the replacement of the instance `_13157_` with the updated OR gate.
![Screenshot](https://github.com/aiishwarrya/nasscom-digital-vlsi-soc/blob/main/screenshots/day4-50.png)

Once confirmed, proceed with the design flow for physical design. Prep the design again to update the necessary variables:
```tcl
prep -design picorv32a -tag 24-03_10-03 -overwrite
```

Include the newly added LEF files:
```tcl
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs
```

Set new values for synthesis strategy and sizing:
```tcl
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1
run_synthesis
```

Proceed with the floorplan, placement, and CTS steps:
```tcl
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or
run_placement
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)
run_cts
```
